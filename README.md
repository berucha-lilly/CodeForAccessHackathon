# **CodeForAccessHackathon**

Welcome to the **Code for Access: The Accessibility Challenge** hackathon repository! This repository is designed to support participants as they work on accessibility-focused coding challenges using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this space provides all the resources, guides, and starter code you need to participate successfully.

## **Overview**

The **Code for Access** hackathon aims to engage participants in building accessible web features that improve user experiences for people with disabilities. This collaborative effort emphasizes inclusive design, hands-on coding, and the real-world impact of accessible software.

## **Predefined Coding Challenges**

Each team will choose one of the following challenges:

1. **Color Contrast Enhancer:**  
   Develop a button that toggles between normal and high-contrast modes, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards to improve readability for users with visual impairments. Starter code and instructions can be found in the `/color-contrast-enhancer` folder.

2. **Accessible Form Validation:**  
   Create a simple form with real-time, accessible error messaging. Ensure error messages are clear, descriptive, screen-reader friendly, and visually accessible without relying solely on color. Starter code and instructions are located in the `/accessible-form-validation` folder.

3. **Keyboard-Friendly Navigation:**  
   Design a dynamic navigation menu fully functional with keyboard controls. Implement intuitive keyboard shortcuts and tab navigation, allowing users to explore the site without using a mouse. The starter code and instructions are in the `/keyboard-friendly-navigation` folder.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Create Your Branch Before You Start Coding**

**Creating your own branch is critical as it allows AWS Amplify to create a unique deployment link for your teamâ€™s work. This ensures each team can see their progress live and demo their work effectively.** 

1. **Open the Code:**
   - Click the **Code** button on the repository's main page to open a Codespace or open the code in an IDE of your choosing.
   - Select **Open with Codespaces** and click **New Codespace** if using Codespace approach.

2. **Create Your Branch:**
   - Once inside your Codespace or IDE of choosing, open the terminal.
   - Create a new branch specific to your team:
     ```
     git checkout -b team-name
     ```
   - Example:
     ```
     git checkout -b team-shelley
     ```

3. **Push Your Branch to GitHub:**
   - Once your branch is created, push it to the CodeForAccessHackathon GitHub repo to trigger AWS Amplify to recognize your branch for deployment:
     ```
     git push origin your-branch-name
     ```

### **2. Work on Your Challenge**

1. Navigate to your assigned challenge folder (`/color-contrast-enhancer`, `/accessible-form-validation`, or `/keyboard-friendly-navigation`).
2. Follow the instructions in the `instructions.md` file specific to your challenge.
3. Use the provided starter code to build and test your solution or create your own files and start from scratch.

### **3. Commit and Push Your Changes Regularly**

- As you work on your code, make sure to regularly commit and push your changes to keep your branch updated. Verify that your changes pushed to the CodeForAccessHackathon GitHub repo specifically:
  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
  git push origin your-branch-name
  ```

### **4. View Your Live Deployment Link**

- AWS Amplify will automatically generate a live deployment link for your branch once it's pushed to GitHub. Your unique URL will be added to the Deployment Links section of this README shortly after pushing your branch.
- Use this link to view your work live and prepare for your demonstration.

## **AWS Amplify Deployment Links** ##
This section lists the deployment links generated by AWS Amplify for each branch. As branches are created and deployed, you can reference this table for the corresponding links to view the live versions of each team's work. (Give 5 mins after branch creation for deployment link to get generated and added)

| **Branch Name**         | **Deployment Link** (Does not open in new tab)                                      |
